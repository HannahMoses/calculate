Feature 1: Create a new user
This feature involved creating a new directory for the user, and adding the user to users.txt
This can be accessed by clicking the link ,"create an account" , on the login page

Feature 2: Delete account
This feature involved creating a confirmation button, deleting the user's directory and all 
files within,and removing the user form users.txt
This feature can be accessed from the fileaccess.php page after logging in with a valid username

Feature 3: Share file with another user
This feature involved checking whether the other user exists, checking that the other user does 
not have a file with the same name, then copying the file.
This feature can be accessed from the fileacces.php page after logging in, and requires input 
of another valid username. (So create two users first).
In practice, since there are no passwords, handing someone else, your username compromises your
entire account, but let's pretend these are all nice, awesome people with files that don't matter.

No additional login details needed! Just start by creating an account.
