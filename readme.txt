THis project makes simple mathematical calculations with two whole numbers.

Therefore before running PHP files, they should be placed inside the web folder of a web server and then make a request to desired PHP file by typing its URL in the web browser. If you installed a web server in your computer, usually the root of its web folder can be accessed by typing http://localhost in the web browser. So, if you placed a file called hello.php inside its web folder, you can run that file by calling http://localhost/hello.php.

Web folder can be changed based on your web host (if you hosted your web site online) or the method you installed the web server in your computer. If you used XAMPP to install Apache (web server) in your computer then the web folder would be htdocs which is under the root directory of XAMPP.

TO EDIT PHP FILES
just syntax highlighting won’t be enough. You will probably need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

An IDE is an application that integrates development tools like a debugger, an interpreter, a version control system with the editor. So it lets you execute many development tasks at one place.

When you choose an IDE, look for following features.

PHP syntax highlighting.
Integrated interpreter so that if you make a syntax mistake it will be immediately visible.
Autofilling that suggests PHP built-in code and the code you have already defined (like variables) when you start typing.
Allowing easy refactoring like changing a method name across a file or across a set of files.
Highlighting unused variables (this will allow you to cleanup your code).
Integrated version controlling so that it clearly shows changed lines and allows you to revert back if needed.
EasyEclipse for PHP and NetBeans for PHP are free and feature-rich IDEs. Both are available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.
